        <p>
          When Tracy McMullen and I started writing, Oracle's documentation was... optimistic. Users needed practical guides written by people who actually implemented the software. So we wrote one. Then another. Then we couldn't stop.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every book in the series is designed to make enterprise software less intimidating. The title, <strong class="dark:text-white text-[var(--color-primary)]">Look Smarter Than You Are</strong>, is the whole philosophy: you don't need to be an expert to use these tools well. You just need a book that doesn't assume you already know everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          All 15 were written before large language models could generate text. We didn't have AI co-authors. We had caffeine, deadlines, and a shared belief that no one should have to read Oracle's official docs if they don't want to.
