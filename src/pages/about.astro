            I started college at 15, founded my first company at 22, and spent the next 30 years building things and talking about them in 50+ countries across all 7 continents. Wrote 15 books. Convinced Oracle to send a shy introvert around the world for 15 years. Now I run AI companies from San Juan, Puerto Rico.

        <p>
          I'm Edward Roske. I run <strong class="dark:text-white text-[var(--color-primary)]">Dawnward</strong> (my investment firm), invest in and contribute to <strong class="dark:text-white text-[var(--color-primary)]">Caprus</strong> (AI for finance teams), and still hold a stake in <strong class="dark:text-white text-[var(--color-primary)]">Argano</strong>, the billion-dollar consulting firm I helped create when I merged my 25-year-old company, interRel, in 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          So what am I actually building? <strong class="dark:text-white text-[var(--color-primary)]">MCP servers</strong> that let AI models talk directly to enterprise financial systems (so your CFO can ask questions in English instead of writing calc scripts). I'm also co-chairing the <strong class="dark:text-white text-[var(--color-primary)]">Caribbean AI Summit</strong>, the largest AI conference Puerto Rico has ever seen. October 16-17, 2026. San Juan. You should come.
        </p>
        <p>
          Master of Data Science from SMU (4.0 GPA, Outstanding Graduate... yes, I mention this a lot). BA from <strong class="dark:text-white text-[var(--color-primary)]">Shimer College</strong>, a Great Books school taught entirely by Socratic Method, which is where "Asking Good Questions" comes from as a philosophy. Started at 15. Full-time at Simon's Rock of Bard College at 16. Took a 20-year detour through entrepreneurship before finishing.
        </p>
        <p>
          First person to score perfectly on the Essbase Certification exam. Oracle ACE Director for 15+ years. Fifteen books. The <strong class="dark:text-white text-[var(--color-primary)]">"Asking Good Questions"</strong> podcast. In 2025, I received ODTUG's Lifetime Achievement Award. Fewer than 5 people have ever been given it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, I'm a Dungeon Master. I recently ran Keith Baker (the creator of the Eberron campaign setting) through a homebrew adventure. He said I was the best-prepared DM he'd ever seen in Eberron. (I peaked.)
