            I build companies and break down complex problems. I started college at 15, founded my first company at 22, and haven't slowed down since. I've spoken in 50+ countries, written 15 books, and somehow convinced Oracle I was worth sending around the world for 15 years. I currently live in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where I spend most of my time at the intersection of AI and finance.

        <p>
          I'm Edward Roske. I run <strong class="dark:text-white text-[var(--color-primary)]">Dawnward</strong> (my investment firm), invest in and contribute to <strong class="dark:text-white text-[var(--color-primary)]">Caprus</strong> (AI for finance teams), and still hold a stake in <strong class="dark:text-white text-[var(--color-primary)]">Argano</strong>, the billion-dollar consulting firm I helped create when I merged my 25-year-old company, interRel, in 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          These days I spend most of my time building <strong class="dark:text-white text-[var(--color-primary)]">MCP servers</strong> that let AI models talk to enterprise financial systems, and co-chairing the <strong class="dark:text-white text-[var(--color-primary)]">Caribbean AI Summit</strong>, what will be the largest AI conference Puerto Rico has ever seen (October 16-17, 2026, San Juan).
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a Master of Data Science from SMU (4.0 GPA, Outstanding Graduate... yes, I bring this up), a BA from Shimer College (started college at 15, went full-time at 16, then took a 20-year detour through entrepreneurship before finishing), and I was the first person to score perfectly on the Essbase Certification exam. I host the <strong class="dark:text-white text-[var(--color-primary)]">"Asking Good Questions"</strong> podcast, I've written 15 books, and I'm an Oracle ACE Director. In 2025, I received ODTUG's Lifetime Achievement Award. Fewer than 5 people have ever been given it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, I'm a Dungeon Master. I recently ran Keith Baker (the creator of the Eberron campaign setting) through a homebrew adventure. He said I was the best-prepared DM he'd ever seen in Eberron. (I peaked.)
