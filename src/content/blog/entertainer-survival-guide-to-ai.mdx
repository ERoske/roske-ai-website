In 1928, Greta Garbo had a problem. She was the biggest star in Hollywood. She was also Swedish. And talkies were coming.

MGM was terrified her accent would end her career. They delayed her first sound film for two years. When "Anna Christie" finally premiered in 1930, the marketing campaign was two words: "Garbo Talks!"

It became the highest-grossing film of 1930. Her accent didn't kill her. It became her signature.

John Gilbert (who did multiple movies with Garbo) wasn't as lucky. His voice didn't match his romantic screen persona. His first talkie flopped. His second flopped worse. He was dead by 38 (and if you're wondering whether career collapse contributed to that, the answer is almost certainly yes, though alcoholism was involved too).

Same technology. Same industry. Same disruption. Completely different outcomes. The difference wasn't talent. Both were enormously talented. The difference was adaptability.

## The One-Trick Pony Problem

An anonymous Hollywood talent agent described AI as *"a tsunami that is gonna wipe out everyone."* Then he said he's *"handing out surfboards."* Teaching people how to surf.

Good metaphor. But who actually needs a surfboard? (Unless you're Kurt Russell in *"Escape from L.A."*)

The CVL Economics study surveyed entertainment industry leaders. 75% said generative AI had already supported job elimination at their companies.

The most vulnerable roles: sound designers (55% of leaders predict displacement), music editors, audio technicians, and studio engineers (around 40%). Notice what those jobs have in common. They're all technical execution roles. Roles where the value proposition is "I can do this specific thing well." One thing. One trick.

The pony problem isn't limited to below-the-line workers. Writers who only write network procedural dialogue? More vulnerable. Writers who construct narratives that make you feel something unexpected? Less so. Actors whose brand is "attractive person in front of camera"? More vulnerable. Actors who bring something irreplaceable to a role? Less so.

(And if your entire value as a human being comes from knowing how to use Final Cut Pro, I have some difficult news.)

## What Actually Makes Someone AI-Proof?

Here's where most "how to survive AI" articles fall apart. They say things like "be more creative" or "develop soft skills." That's useless advice. (It's the career equivalent of telling someone to "just be yourself" at a job interview.)

Let me be specific.

**1. Have a point of view.**

AI can generate competent, generic content at scale. It cannot have an opinion. It cannot take a position and defend it against pushback. It cannot look at a dataset and say "this is wrong and here's why everyone's been thinking about it backwards."

Matthew McConaughey partnered with ElevenLabs, cloned his own voice, invested in the company, and is generating Spanish-language versions of his newsletter. He didn't fight the technology. He fed it his most distinctive asset: his voice. (His actual voice, not just his talent, though both are distinctive enough that AI cloning them makes the clone more valuable, not less.) On that note, check out McConaughey and Chalamet's [joint CNN Town Hall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=424w9fJRgYk) where Matthew does a great job of talking about how AI is going to affect Hollywood.

Roger Avary won an Oscar for co-writing *"Pulp Fiction"* but couldn't get a movie made through traditional Hollywood channels. He launched an AI production company and now has three features in active production. He didn't replace himself with AI. He used AI to bypass the gatekeepers who were blocking his point of view from reaching an audience.

**2. Own your identity as an asset.**

Bong Joon-ho joked he wants to *"organize a military squad to destroy AI."* Then he admitted he used AI for visual effects in *"Mickey 17."* His honest answer was better than his joke: *"AI is good because it's the very beginning of the human race finally seriously thinking about what only humans can do."*

The real question is: what do only YOU do?

If the answer is *"the same thing as 10,000 other people but maybe slightly better,"* AI is a problem. If the answer is *"something that is recognizably mine,"* AI is a tool.

Garbo's accent wasn't a liability. It was an identity. Gilbert's voice wasn't a liability because it was bad. It was a liability because it was generic. It could have belonged to anyone.

**3. Build at the intersection, not the center.**

The solo creator who understands storytelling *AND* AI tools *AND* audience distribution is more valuable than the traditional crew member who does one of those things at a world-class level.

Content creators who adopted AI tools early are producing 5 to 10 times more video than their 2024 counterparts, with an 80 to 95% decrease in per-video production costs. 73% of viewers can't distinguish high-quality AI-assisted video from traditional production in blind testing.

Rather than replacing creativity, that's democratizing production. The competitive advantage has shifted from *"can you make a professional video"* (anyone can now) to *"do you have something worth saying"* (most people don't).

**4. Treat distribution as a skill, not a byproduct.**

The creator economy is projected to approach $500 billion by 2027. That money flows to individuals who build direct audiences, not to people who wait for studios or networks to choose them.

Brad Tangonan, an indie filmmaker, put it simply: *"AI is a facilitator. I'm still making all the creative decisions."* He's right. But only because he's making decisions worth making.

## The Framework in One Sentence

If a computer can do what you do, you're John Gilbert. If a computer makes what you do reach more people, you're Greta Garbo.

That's it. That's the whole survival guide.

The technology is here. Seedance 2.0 just generated unauthorized Tom Cruise fighting Brad Pitt in photorealistic video. Runway is valued at $5.3 billion. Disney licensed Marvel and Star Wars to an AI company.

The 2026 SAG-AFTRA negotiations are happening right now. None of this is going away.

The entertainers who survive will be the ones who asked *"how do I use this?"* instead of *"how do I stop this?"*

My father used to say: if you're going to laugh about it someday, laugh about it now.

Hollywood is going to look back on this moment the way the music industry looks back on MTV's launch. Some people will laugh. Some won't.

(Learn to surf.)
