I was talking to a CFO last week about the finer points of his $50 million ERP implementation. Specifically, why his high-priced (and deservedly so) consultants were spending so long on data validation. Then it hit me: we were debating the best way to build a horse-drawn carriage factory in 1905. The Ford Model T was already rolling off assembly lines, but there they sat, meticulously planning out the finest buggy whip manufacturing processes money could buy.

(I don't know exactly what a "buggy whip" is because it's 2026 and I don't have to. Which is kinda my point.)

Here's the uncomfortable truth that most companies refuse to acknowledge: any digital transformation strategy created before 2025 is fundamentally broken. Not outdated. Not in need of minor adjustments. Broken. These strategies were built on a foundational assumption that has completely crumbled beneath our feet: that humans would do most of the work, with computers serving as sophisticated calculators and filing cabinets.

That world doesn't exist anymore (assuming it ever really did in the first place, which is debatable if you've ever watched someone try to use Excel as a database).

## The Great Assumption Collapse

Every transformation roadmap I've seen from the bygone days of the pre-2025 era follows the same pattern: take human processes, digitize them, maybe add some automation around the edges, and call it innovation. We built systems that assumed Bob from Accounting would still be manually reviewing invoices, just with a slightly nicer interface. We designed workflows that required human approval at seventeen different stages because, well, that's how we'd always done things.

But here's what happened while we were busy digitizing our org charts: AI didn't just get better at following our existing processes. It got better at making those processes irrelevant entirely.

I watched a client spend eighteen months implementing a sophisticated workflow system for contract reviews. Multiple approval layers. Elaborate routing logic. The works. Then their legal team quietly started using AI to handle 80% of those documents in about thirty seconds each. The beautifully crafted workflow system became an expensive monument to solving yesterday's problems.

## The Million-Dollar Question (Literally)

If you're currently knee-deep in a digital transformation project (and statistically speaking, you probably are), stop. Just for a moment. Ask yourself this: would you design these same systems if you were starting from scratch today, knowing what AI can do right now?

Not what it might do in five years. What it can do today, while you're reading this.

Because here's the thing about technology implementations: they take forever. By the time you finish building that meticulously planned system (assuming you finish it at all, which historical data suggests is optimistic), the world will have moved on without you. You'll have spent millions creating something that was obsolete before the first user logged in.

It's like planning a cross-country trip by horse in 1925 because that's what the transportation strategy document recommended. And honestly, those horses had been working fine for centuries, so why change now?

Or to put it a different way: if your company had no existing processes, is this what you'd build?

## The New Reality Check

In 2026, we don't build processes that assume humans will handle routine cognitive work any more than we build processes that assume humans will carry messages on foot between offices. The question isn't "How do we digitize this human task?" It's "Why is this still a human task at all?"

That financial reconciliation process that requires six people and takes three days? AI can do it in minutes. That market research project you've allocated twelve weeks for? AI can synthesize more data sources than your team could read in a year. And do it before lunch.

The customer service escalation matrix with fourteen decision trees? Unnecessary when AI can handle nuanced conversations and know exactly when to involve humans (which turns out to be far less often than we thought).

## What You Should Do Right Now

Here's your action plan. It's simpler than you think.

Pause every transformation project you're working on and ask one question: "Does this make sense in a world where AI handles most routine cognitive work?"

If the answer is no (and it probably is), you have two choices: redesign it from the ground up with AI-first assumptions, or kill it entirely and redirect those resources toward something that actually matters in 2026.

Yes, this means admitting that some of those beautifully detailed project plans were solving the wrong problems entirely. Yes, it means having uncomfortable conversations about sunk costs and changed assumptions. And yes, it means you get to send an email to your Big 4 Accounting firm asking them why they didn't suggest rethinking the projects themselves.

But it also means not spending millions building digital buggy whips while your competitors are learning to fly.

The companies that excel (not the Microsoft kind) in the next five years won't be the ones with the most sophisticated human-centric systems. They'll be the ones brave enough to abandon those systems entirely and build something actually relevant to the world we're living in now.

The transformation you really need isn't digital. It's mental.
