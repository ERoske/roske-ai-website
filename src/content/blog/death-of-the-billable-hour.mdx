title: "It's Time for the Death of the Billable Hour"
description: "AI compresses a 200-hour engagement into 40 hours. If you're still charging by the hour, you're either overcharging or going broke. Neither is a good strategy."

I founded a consulting firm at 22. I ran it for 25 years. I merged it into a billion-dollar company. I understand the billable hour model because I lived inside it for a quarter century.

It's time for it to go.

## The Math Doesn't Work Anymore

Here's the problem. AI compresses delivery time. A data migration that took 200 consultant-hours last year takes 40 this year. The quality is the same or better. The client gets their result faster. Everyone should be happy.

Except the firm that was billing for 200 hours just lost 80% of its revenue on that engagement. If you charge by the hour and your tools make you faster, you get punished for being good at your job. That's not a business model. That's a penalty for innovation.

The consulting industry has known this was coming. Most firms have responded by pretending it isn't. A [recent analysis](https://futureofconsulting.ai/ai-leadership/2026-consultings-ai-revolution-update/) described the industry's AI transformation as "more thunder than lightning," which is a polite way of saying everybody talks about AI at their all-hands meeting and then sends the same team to do the same work the same way. (If that sounds like a company you've hired, I'm sorry. And also: you should stop hiring them.)

## What Replaces It

Outcome-based pricing. Subscription models. Value-based engagements. Pick your term. The core idea is the same: charge for what you deliver, not how long it takes you to deliver it.

If a client needs their financial close cycle reduced from 15 days to 5, the value of that outcome is the same whether it takes your team 500 hours or 50. The client doesn't care how many hours you spent. They care that their close cycle is now 5 days.

This terrifies traditional consulting firms because their entire economic model is built on utilization rates and hourly billing. Partners track billable hours like airlines track seat miles. The idea of decoupling revenue from time spent is existentially uncomfortable for organizations that have optimized around exactly that coupling for decades.

## Why Firms Can't Let Go

Three reasons, and none of them are technical.

**Measurement.** Hours are easy to track. Value is harder. How do you price the outcome of a strategic advisory engagement? What's the dollar value of "better decision-making"? Firms don't have frameworks for this yet, and building them requires admitting the old framework is broken.

**Culture.** Associates get promoted based on billable hours. Partners evaluate teams on utilization. The entire career ladder from analyst to partner is calibrated in hours. Changing the pricing model means changing the incentive structure, which means changing the culture. Most firms would rather change their logo.

**The 100-page PDF.** Traditional consulting delivers thick reports. The deliverable IS the hours. You're paying for someone to research, analyze, and write a document that proves they worked. AI can do the research and first-draft analysis in a fraction of the time, which means the 100-page report either gets produced in 10 hours instead of 100 (destroying the revenue model) or it gets replaced by something more useful. Like, say, a deployed AI agent that actually does the ongoing analysis instead of a PDF that sits in someone's inbox.

## How I Think About This

When I built interRel, we charged by the hour because that's what the industry did. We optimized for utilization. We tracked billable hours religiously. And it worked for 25 years because the tools changed slowly enough that the hours stayed consistent.

AI broke that. The tools don't change slowly anymore.

Caprus is built on a different model from the start. We build MCP servers and AI tools for enterprise finance. The value is in the product and the domain expertise, not in how many hours someone sat in front of a screen. A client using our Essbase MCP server gets the same value whether it took us 1,000 hours or 100 hours to build it. They're paying for access to 30 years of Essbase expertise packaged into a tool that works with their AI stack.

Expertise becomes product. Product scales. Hours don't.

## The Pyramid Is Still Standing

It won't be for long. The AI consulting market is projected to grow from $11 billion to $91 billion by 2035. Companies expect to double their AI spending this year. Gartner says 40% of enterprise applications will feature AI agents by the end of 2026 (up from 5% in 2025).

All of that demand is going to flow toward firms that price on outcomes, not hours. The firms still selling the pyramid (expensive partner does the sales call, mid-level manager runs the project, junior analysts do the work, everyone bills hourly) will find their clients asking a reasonable question: why am I paying for 200 hours of work when your AI tools can do it in 40?

The honest answer is: you shouldn't be. The firm that says that first wins the client.

My career was built on billable hours. I have nothing but respect for the model that fed my family for 25 years. But clinging to it now isn't loyalty. It's denial.

(If you're going to laugh about it someday, laugh about it now. My father was right about most things.)
