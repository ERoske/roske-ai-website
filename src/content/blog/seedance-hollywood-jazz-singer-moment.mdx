Two weeks ago, ByteDance released Seedance 2.0. Within hours, the internet was flooded with AI-generated videos. Tom Cruise fighting Brad Pitt. Will Smith in scenes he never filmed. SAG-AFTRA President (!) Sean Astin reprising Samwise Gamgee without anyone asking his permission.

The union and the Motion Picture Association issued a joint statement calling it *"blatant infringement"* and *"unacceptable."* Rhett Reese, who wrote a lot of *"Deadpool & Wolverine,"* posted that it was *"likely over"* for writers. Hollywood collectively lost its mind.

They're right to be alarmed. They're wrong about what it means.

## This Is October 6, 1927

When Al Jolson said *"You ain't heard nothing yet"* in *"The Jazz Singer,"* the silent film industry didn't collapse because of one movie. It collapsed because one movie proved the technology worked.

Seedance 2.0 is that moment for AI video.

Not because it's perfect. It isn't. Not because ByteDance respected anyone's IP rights. They **obviously** didn't.

But because millions of people watched those videos and said *"wait, WHAT?"* That's the sound of a technological threshold being crossed. You don't uncross it.

The silent-to-talkie transition took three years. Three years from *"The Jazz Singer"* to the functional death of silent film (and along with it, the silent film actors and the orchestras who used to play along with the silent films). The entire industry restructured between 1927 and 1930.

We're about six months past our *"Jazz Singer"* moment. (And yes, I'm aware that comparing ByteDance to Al Jolson is a stretch. But the pattern holds even if the analogy is imperfect.)

## The Response Tells You Everything

Look at who reacted and how.

Guillermo del Toro said he'd *"rather die"* than use generative AI. Rian Johnson said *"fuck AI"* (a rare case where I think strategic profanity is warranted). James Cameron called it *"horrifying."* Jenna Ortega said it feels like *"we've opened up a Pandora's Box"* (and when Wednesday is worried, that's worrisome in itself).

Now look at the other side.

Disney invested $1 billion in OpenAI. Licensed 200 characters. Starting in 2026, users can create AI videos featuring Marvel and Star Wars characters through Sora. An ARK Invest analyst called it *"a dividing line in entertainment history."*

Jeffrey Katzenberg, who co-founded DreamWorks Animation, said AI would reduce the people needed to make a world-class animated movie to 10% of current levels. Not a reduction. A decimation. (And I mean that in the original Latin sense, which is actually the *optimistic* interpretation.)

Amazon launched a dedicated AI Studio for proprietary film and TV production tools. Netflix used GenAI for de-aging in *"Happy Gilmore 2."* It shipped. On the world's largest streaming platform.

Here's the pattern: the people who make things with their hands are terrified. The people who own things are investing billions. This is exactly what happened with talkies, MTV, and streaming.

## But What About the Lawsuits?

New York signed two first-in-the-nation bills in December 2025. One requires disclosure when AI performers appear in advertising. The other forbids using deceased performers' likenesses without estate consent. SAG-AFTRA filed an unfair labor practice charge over the AI-generated James Earl Jones voice used for Darth Vader in Fortnite.

The 2026 contract negotiations between SAG-AFTRA and the studios are underway right now. AI is (and I'm quoting IndieWire here) *"perhaps the most complex issue on the table."*

All of this matters. None of it will stop the technology.

The American Federation of Musicians spent $10 million fighting *"canned music"* in 1929. They printed buttons. They picketed theaters. They had public sympathy. They had a legitimate grievance. And they lost. Completely.

SAG-AFTRA's Duncan Crabtree-Ireland has a smarter strategy than the 1929 musicians did. He wants to make AI performers cost the same as human ones through taxation and licensing fees. *"If synthetics cost the same as a human,"* he said, *"they're going to choose a human every time."* That's clever. That might slow things down. (It won't stop them, but slowing them down gives people time to adapt, which is probably the best realistic outcome.)

## The Numbers Hollywood Can't Ignore

Los Angeles County lost 41,000 entertainment jobs between 2022 and 2025. That's a quarter of the entertainment workforce. (Cue certain people saying that Hollywood, and California taxes, did this to themselves, but whatever the causes, it's still a quarter of the workforce.)

Film and TV production jobs in California dropped 35% from 2022 to Q1 2025. Sound stage occupancy fell from over 90% to 63%. Writer available gigs fell 42% from 2023 to 2024. The writers struck over AI, won contractual protections, and still lost 42% of their gigs the following year. The protections matter. But they didn't stop the market from contracting.

Meanwhile, Kling AI (one Chinese platform) generated $140 million in revenue in 2025. One platform. $140 million. Runway is valued at $5.3 billion. Luma AI at $4 billion. Global AI startup funding hit $89.4 billion in 2025, representing 34% of all venture capital.

The money has picked a side. (It usually does.)

## What Happens Next

Seedance 2.0 was sloppy, unauthorized, and legally indefensible. It was also a demonstration that a single AI tool can generate convincing video of recognizable celebrities in scenes that never happened.

ByteDance pledged fixes and IP safeguards. They'll add guardrails but a whole lot of other companies (many from China where IP is a male character in a martial arts franchise) will not. Other companies will build similar tools with proper licensing. Disney is already doing this. The technology gets more legal, more polished, and more accessible every month.

The question for Hollywood isn't *"can we stop this?"* You can't uninvent the talkie. You can't uninvent MTV. You can't uninvent streaming. And you can't uninvent Seedance 2.0.

The question is whether you're Al Jolson or a theater pianist. Whether you're Michael Jackson on MTV or a face-for-radio artist in 1983. Whether you're Netflix or Blockbuster.

Sean Astin said *"the act of performance must remain human-centered."* I agree with him. I also notice that agreeing with him doesn't change the economics.

(And for what it's worth, if anyone was going to lead the fight against AI-generated hobbits, I'm glad it's an actual hobbit. And on that note, Sean Astin is an American treasure because Goonies never say die.)
