I'm training to hike to Mount Everest Base Camp in Nepal. This is not a sentence I ever expected to write.

I've visited 80+ countries across all 7 continents. I've keynoted conferences on every continent including Antarctica. But none of that involves walking uphill for 10 days at 17,600 feet with half the oxygen you're used to. Giving a talk in a warm conference room with excellent WiFi is a fundamentally different kind of challenge (and one where my skill set is considerably more relevant).

## How This Happened

My wife Dawn suggested it. Dawn is usually right about things like this, even when (especially when) the suggestion makes me deeply uncomfortable. I've spent 25+ years building companies, giving presentations, and sitting in chairs. If you don't deliberately choose something that's physically hard at some point, you optimize your way into a very comfortable, very sedentary existence. My father used to say "no one can take your experiences," and I suspect he was not referring to quarterly business reviews.

## The Training Situation

I'm currently in the best shape I've been in since college, which is both encouraging and a spectacularly low bar. Here's what the training involves:

- **Cardio at altitude simulation.** Treadmill incline walking with a weighted pack. It is exactly as glamorous as it sounds.
- **Strength training.** Legs, core, all the muscles you need to go up and come back down without destroying your knees. I've learned that "leg day" is not a joke and that the people who complain about it on the internet are not exaggerating.
- **Actual hiking.** Puerto Rico has hills. They are not Everest-sized hills, but they exist, and I am walking up them with a pack on while tourists look at me like I'm confused.

The altitude is the real wildcard. You can train your legs and you can train your lungs, but you cannot fully simulate the fact that there's 50% less oxygen at base camp than at sea level. Your body either acclimates or it doesn't, and there's no spreadsheet that can predict which way it goes. (I've tried. The spreadsheet was inconclusive.)

## Three Things I'm Learning

**Preparation is not the same as planning.** In business, I plan everything. I have spreadsheets. I have contingencies for my contingencies. For Everest Base Camp, the plan is relatively simple: walk uphill for several days, don't die, come back. The preparation, actually making your body capable of executing that simple plan, is where all the work lives. Most of my career has been the opposite: complex plans, minimal physical preparation. Turns out the mountain doesn't care how elegant your Gantt chart is.

**Vegetarian food at altitude is a genuine concern.** I've been a vegetarian for decades, and at altitude in Nepal, the protein options narrow considerably. Everyone tells me that dal bhat (lentils and rice) is the answer to everything. The Nepali saying is apparently "dal bhat power, 24 hour." I'm choosing to believe this because the alternative is worrying about it, which burns calories I'll need.

**The mountain doesn't care about your credentials.** I have a 180 IQ, a perfect GPA, a stack of awards, and 15 published books. None of that matters at 17,600 feet. The mountain doesn't read your resume. It just asks whether you can take one more step. As someone who has spent most of his adult life accumulating credentials, I find the mountain's total indifference to them genuinely refreshing (and slightly terrifying).

## What's Next

I'm not disclosing the exact dates yet, because I've learned that announcing ambitious physical goals before you've proven you can achieve them is a great way to create a story where you're the punchline. I'll share more details when I'm closer and more confident that my knees will cooperate.

If you're a fellow desk-bound executive who's been thinking about doing something physically challenging, I'd encourage you to start training sooner than you think you need to. Your body is more adaptable than you'd expect, but it also takes longer to adapt than your optimism suggests (ask me how I know).
