Everest Base Camp has been on my bucket list for over 20 years. In April, I'm finally doing it. I should be standing at 17,600 feet around April 15th, assuming my body cooperates and the weather doesn't have other plans.

The bigger challenge was convincing my wife Dawn to come with me. Dawn is an artist. She paints in oils and watercolors. She is not a person you'd associate with extreme altitude hiking. Neither am I, frankly. But I don't want to be sitting on the porch of a senior care facility in 50 years with no one to share the memory with. That argument worked (eventually).

Now Dawn is training right alongside me. She looks amazingly toned. I look like a CEO who recently discovered cardio. We're both making progress, just at different levels of visual impressiveness.

## Context

I've visited 80+ countries across all 7 continents. I've keynoted conferences on every one of them, including Antarctica. But conferences involve podiums, PowerPoint, and climate-controlled rooms. The most physically demanding part of any conference is navigating the buffet line while avoiding small talk (which I'm very good at avoiding, for what it's worth).

Last year I hiked through Son Doong Cave in Vietnam, the largest cave in the world. Mud, underground rivers, camping inside a cave for multiple nights. It proved I could do something physical and uncomfortable for an extended period without quitting or complaining excessively. Everest Base Camp is the logical next step, assuming your logic is "what's harder and higher and colder?"

My father used to say "no one can take your experiences." I suspect he was not referring to quarterly business reviews.

## The Training

I'm currently in the best cardiovascular shape I've been in since college, which is both encouraging and a spectacularly low bar. Here's what training looks like for a 51-year-old CEO who spent most of his career optimizing for conference WiFi instead of VO2 max:

- **Incline treadmill with a weighted pack.** This is exactly as glamorous as it sounds. You walk uphill on a machine while wearing a backpack full of weight. Other gym members look at you with a mix of curiosity and pity.
- **Leg and core strength work.** Your knees need to survive going up AND coming back down, which turns out to be the harder part. I've learned that "leg day" is not an internet joke. Those people were serious.
- **Hiking in Puerto Rico with a pack on.** Puerto Rico has hills. They are not Himalayan hills, but they exist, and walking up them while tourists look at you like you're confused about where the beach is has its own kind of charm.

The real wildcard is altitude. You can train your legs and lungs at sea level, but you cannot simulate 50% less oxygen. Your body either acclimates or it doesn't. There's no spreadsheet for this. (I tried to make one. The results were inconclusive.)

## What I'm Learning

**Preparation and planning are different things.** I've spent my whole career planning. Spreadsheets, contingency plans, Gantt charts for my Gantt charts. Everest Base Camp doesn't need any of that.

The plan is: walk uphill, acclimatize, don't die, come back. The preparation, actually making your body capable of executing that simple plan, is where all the work lives. Turns out the mountain doesn't care how elegant your project timeline is.

**Being vegetarian at altitude is a real consideration.** I've been vegetarian for decades, and protein options above 14,000 feet narrow considerably. Everyone tells me dal bhat (lentils and rice) is the answer to everything. The Nepali saying is "dal bhat power, 24 hour." I'm choosing to believe this because the alternative is worrying about it, which burns calories I'll need for walking.

**The mountain doesn't read resumes.** I have a 180 IQ, a perfect GPA, 15 published books, and more conference keynotes than I can count. None of that matters at 17,600 feet. The mountain just asks whether you can take one more step. As someone who has spent most of his adult life accumulating credentials, I find the mountain's total indifference to them genuinely refreshing (and slightly terrifying).

## What's Next

April. Nepal. 17,600 feet. I'll post updates from the trail if the WiFi gods are merciful (and at that altitude, mercy is not guaranteed). If I don't make it back (great, now I jinxed myself), tell my family I love them.
