They're the people you call when you want this stuff actually implemented. But more on that later. I've spent 25 years helping CFOs make sense of their data. For most of that time, that meant building reports, writing queries, and begging IT for access to systems. Today I want to show you something that changes the fundamental equation of how finance people interact with their data. We're going to talk about MCPs - and how they let AI do the heavy lifting of pulling, analyzing, and interpreting your financial data. No coding required. Just plain English."

      "speaker_notes": "Here's the situation most of you live in every day. You've got an ERP system. Maybe SAP, maybe Oracle, maybe Dynamics. You've got an EPM tool for planning and consolidation. You've got a general ledger. You've got spreadsheets - lots of spreadsheets. And every one of these systems has its own interface, its own query language, its own way of doing things. The data is there. Getting to it efficiently? That's the problem. You spend more time extracting and formatting data than actually analyzing it. I've watched CFOs spend entire Fridays just getting the numbers ready for Monday's board meeting. That's not a good use of anyone's time."

And it comes back with the answer. Not a link to a report. Not instructions on how to build a query. The actual answer, pulled live from your EPM system. That's what we're going to talk about today. And the technology that makes it possible has a name: MCP."

      "speaker_notes": "If you remember the old days of computing - and I do, unfortunately - every device had its own connector. Printers had parallel ports. Mice had serial ports. Keyboards had their own thing. It was a mess. Then USB came along and said: one connector, everything works. MCP does the same thing for AI. It stands for Model Context Protocol, but you don't need to remember that. What matters is what it does: it creates a standard way for AI to connect to your data. Before MCP, if you wanted AI to talk to your ERP system, you needed custom development. A dedicated integration. Developer time. Budget fights. With MCP, you build one connector and any AI tool can use it. One standard. Universal access. Every major AI company supports it - Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Microsoft. This isn't a proprietary play. It's an industry standard."

      "speaker_notes": "Here's what MCP does in practice. You ask the AI a question - 'What were our top 10 expense categories in Q3?' The AI uses MCP to connect to whatever system has the answer - your ERP, your data warehouse, your EPM tool. It pulls the data, organizes it, and gives you the answer. You never see the connection. You never write a query. You never log into the source system. Think of it like this: before MCP, every time you needed data from a different system, you needed someone who knew that system's language. MCP gives the AI fluency in all of them. So instead of asking your IT team or your FP&A analyst to pull the data, you just ask the AI directly. (Your FP&A team will thank you. Or possibly panic. Either way.)"

FactSet launched an MCP connector for financial data - 45 firms and over 800 institutional users adopted it within months. S&P Global connected Capital IQ data to Claude through MCP. Microsoft built an MCP connector for Dynamics 365. Companies are building these for Oracle EPM, for Snowflake, for accounting platforms. Every major AI company supports the standard.

      "speaker_notes": "Let's map out the financial system landscape. Most organizations have some combination of these: an ERP for transactions - SAP, Oracle, Dynamics, NetSuite. An EPM system for planning, budgeting, and consolidation - Oracle EPM, OneStream, Anaplan. A general ledger. A cloud data warehouse - Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery - where you're centralizing your financial data. BI tools - Power BI, Tableau - for visualization and reporting. Treasury management. Tax systems. And external market data feeds. Here's the key: every one of these can be MCP-connected. And because MCP is a universal standard, you don't need a separate integration for each one. Connect your data warehouse, and every AI tool in your organization can query it. The major vendors are already building these connectors. You don't have to start from scratch."

It gives AI access to ERP data and business actions - purchase orders, journal entries, vendor records, inventory data - all accessible through natural language. And this isn't read-only. With proper authorization, an AI agent could post a journal entry, create a purchase order, or run an inventory adjustment. (I know. Some of you just felt a chill. We'll talk about controls later.) SAP and Oracle are building similar capabilities. By the end of this year, most major ERPs will have MCP connectors available."

Think about what you do in EPM: financial consolidation, planning, budgeting, forecasting, scenario modeling. All of it involves pulling data, running calculations, reviewing results, and making adjustments. With MCP, you could say to the AI: 'Run the Q4 forecast using the aggressive growth assumptions and compare it to the base case.' And it would connect to your Oracle EPM or OneStream instance, run both scenarios, pull the results, and present you with a comparison. No navigating through menus. No building report definitions. Just a question and an answer. This isn't theoretical - Revvence has already published research on extending Oracle EPM into AI-driven workflows using MCP."

      "speaker_notes": "The general ledger is where the truth lives. Every transaction, every journal entry, every adjustment. But querying a GL effectively requires knowing the chart of accounts, understanding the coding structure, knowing which segments to filter on. Most of you rely on someone else to pull this data. MCP changes that. You ask: 'What were our top 10 expense categories in Q3, and how do they compare to Q2?' or 'Show me all journal entries over $50,000 posted in the last week of the quarter.' The AI handles the query. You get the answer. And it can flag things a human might miss - like unusual patterns in journal entries that could indicate errors or (let's be honest) something worse."

And you've got BI tools - Power BI, Tableau - sitting on top. The problem? Getting ad hoc answers still requires either technical skills or waiting for someone with technical skills. MCP eliminates that bottleneck. You ask in plain English: 'What was our customer acquisition cost by channel for the last four quarters, and how does it trend?' The AI translates that into the right query, runs it against your warehouse, and presents the result. No waiting for IT. No submitting a ticket. And the numbers stay consistent with your dashboards because the AI pulls from the same data models. It becomes a natural language front-end for your entire analytics stack.

Then someone updates an API. Or the schema changes. Or you upgrade the ERP. And suddenly your integration breaks and nobody knows why until the Monday morning report doesn't run. We've all lived through this. MCP is fundamentally different because it's a standard. When your ERP vendor updates their system, they update their MCP connector. Your AI tools don't care - they're still speaking the same standard. It's like how upgrading your phone doesn't break your USB-C cable. The standard doesn't change when the systems behind it evolve."

Through MCP, AI can now access FactSet's fundamentals, estimates, ownership data, M&A transactions, pricing data, and more - all through natural language. You could ask: 'What's the consensus EPS estimate for Microsoft, and how has it changed over the last three quarters?' And it pulls the answer from FactSet in real time. No terminal. No separate login. No export-to-Excel dance. (I know some of you just got emotional about that last one.)"

This includes Capital IQ financials, earnings call transcripts, company profiles, and more. Think about what this means. An analyst can now ask: 'Summarize the key themes from Amazon's last three earnings calls and flag any changes in management's tone around capital expenditure.' And the AI goes and gets the transcripts, reads them, and gives you the analysis. That used to be a junior analyst's entire Friday. Now it takes 30 seconds.

Your internal financial data - the stuff that lives in your ERP, your EPM system, your data warehouse. That's where the competitive advantage is. Any company can query public market data. But only you can ask: 'How does our actual manufacturing cost per unit compare to our budget assumptions by plant location for the last six months, and where are the biggest variances?' That requires access to your internal data. And that's exactly what a custom MCP connector enables. You build it once, and then every AI tool in your organization can use it. One connection, universal access."

      "speaker_notes": "Let me define 'agentic' because it gets thrown around a lot. A regular AI interaction is: you ask a question, you get an answer. One step. Agentic AI is different. You give it a goal - like 'prepare the monthly close analysis' - and it figures out the steps on its own. It pulls the trial balance. It compares to prior month and prior year. It identifies significant variances. It researches the causes. It drafts the narrative. Multiple steps, working autonomously. It's the difference between asking someone to hand you a wrench and asking someone to fix the sink. MCP is what makes this possible, because it gives the AI the ability to actually interact with your systems - not just read from them, but take actions."

It analyzes what it found - calculates variances, identifies trends, spots anomalies. Step three: Act. It digs deeper - running a drill-down query, pulling supporting documentation, checking a related system. Step four: Report. It presents its findings in whatever format you need. And here's the key: steps one through three can repeat multiple times before it reports. The AI might pull data, notice something unexpected, dig deeper, find the root cause, then report. Just like a good analyst would. Except it does it in minutes, not days. (And it never asks for a raise.)"

In the old world, you email the cost accounting team, wait a day, get a spreadsheet back, dig through it, send follow-up questions. With an MCP-connected AI agent, you type: 'What drove the $2.3M variance in COGS this quarter?' The agent connects to your ERP, pulls the detailed COGS transactions. It compares to budget by category. It identifies that raw material costs in Plant 3 spiked in August due to a supplier price increase. It pulls the purchase orders to confirm. It checks whether the new pricing is reflected in the Q4 forecast. And it reports all of this back to you in about 30 seconds. One question. Complete answer."

It reviews journal entries for completeness. It identifies accounts with unusual balances. And it sends you a summary: '14 of 16 entities have completed their close. Intercompany is out of balance by $47K between Entity 5 and Entity 12. Three unusual journal entries flagged for review.' You go from spending hours checking status to getting a proactive briefing.

Normally, it takes your FP&A team a week to assemble. With an AI agent connected via MCP to your EPM, ERP, HRIS, and data warehouse, you say: 'Prepare the Q3 board data package.' The agent pulls revenue and margin data from your EPM system. It gets cash flow details from your ERP. It grabs headcount from your HR system. It compiles the forecast comparison. It generates the charts and narrative summaries. It doesn't replace the judgment your FP&A team brings.

Each question builds on the last. The AI remembers the context.

      "speaker_notes": "There are three paths, and most organizations will use all three. Path one: Use what already exists. FactSet, S&P Global, Microsoft Dynamics - they've already built MCP connectors. If you use those platforms, you can start today. Literally today. Path two: Build connectors for your internal systems. This is where your IT team - or the nice people over at Caprus AI - come in. Building an MCP connector for your data warehouse or EPM system is a focused project - weeks, not months. Not years. It's not a full system implementation. It's closer to building a report writer that speaks a standard language. And if you need an existing connector configured for your environment, that's exactly what firms like Caprus do. Path three: Start small. Pick one use case. Variance analysis. Board prep. Cash forecasting. Prove the value with one process before you try to connect everything. The organizations getting the most value aren't doing big-bang rollouts. They're starting with one painful process and expanding from there."

      "speaker_notes": "I want to address the elephant in the room. When I tell CFOs 'we're going to let AI access your financial systems,' I can see the blood drain from their faces. So let me be clear. This is not uncontrolled access. You control exactly which data the AI can see, which actions it can take, and who can use it. Read-only access for most users. Write access only for specific, approved workflows with proper authorization. Full audit logging for every query and every action - every question asked, every data point returned. Your SOX auditors can review exactly what the AI accessed and when. And honestly, it's more auditable than most of the processes it replaces. (When was the last time you had a complete audit trail of who opened which spreadsheet on the shared drive and changed what? Right.)"

FactSet has a production connector with 800+ institutional users. S&P Global integrated Capital IQ data into Claude. Microsoft has a connector for Dynamics 365 ERP. CData built connectors for Xero and other accounting platforms. There are open-source connectors for various accounting tools. Financial Datasets has a connector for stock market data. And new ones are launching every month. For custom internal systems, companies are building their own - and the standard makes this significantly easier than building traditional integrations. The ecosystem is growing fast. By the time you finish your next planning cycle, the options will have doubled."

The future is not AI replacing your finance team. The future is your finance team working alongside AI agents. One agent monitors the close process. Another handles variance analysis. A third manages cash forecasting. A fourth does continuous audit monitoring. They all connect to your systems through MCP, and they coordinate with each other. Your people handle the judgment, the strategy, the stakeholder communication, the 'what should we do about this?' Less time in spreadsheets, more time doing the work that actually requires a human brain. That's not a dystopian future. That's a better job."

      "speaker_notes": "So what should you actually do? Three things. First: Experiment. Pick one use case - variance analysis, report generation, data exploration - and try it with an MCP-connected AI. FactSet and S&P Global integrations are available today in Claude. Start there. See what's possible. Second: Identify. Look at your finance processes and identify where the most time is spent on data gathering versus analysis. Those high-gathering processes are your MCP opportunities. Where are your people spending 80% of their time just finding the numbers? Start there. Third: Plan. Start conversations with your IT team and your system vendors about MCP readiness. Ask Microsoft about their Dynamics connector. Ask Oracle about their EPM roadmap. Ask your data warehouse team about building an internal connector. The organizations that move first will have a significant advantage. Not because the technology is hard to adopt - it isn't - but because the organizational learning takes time. Getting your team comfortable working alongside AI is a cultural shift, not a technical one."

It's about eliminating the friction between you and the information you need to make decisions. No more waiting for reports. No more reformatting data between systems. No more 'let me get back to you on that.' Just questions and answers. Analysis on demand. Insights at the speed of conversation. That's not hype. It's here, it's production-ready, and it's being adopted by hundreds of organizations right now. The only question is whether you'll be in the first wave or the second."

They build these connectors, they configure them, they get you from 'that sounds cool' to 'that's running in production.' My email is Edward@Roske.AI if you want to continue the conversation. I also host a podcast called 'Asking Good Questions,' which is basically what I've been encouraging you to do for the last hour. The AI handles the answers. Your job is to ask the right questions.\n\nAsking good questions,\nEdward"
