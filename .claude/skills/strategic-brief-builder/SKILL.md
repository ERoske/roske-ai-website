## Example Output (Abbreviated)

# Strategic Brief
**Should We Expand to European Markets?**

## Executive Summary

**The Question**: Should we actively pursue European clients or remain US-focused?

**Recommendation**: **Pursue European expansion via test-first approach.**

Accept European inbound clients, deliver 2-3 pilots in H1 2026, evaluate results, then decide on full GTM in H2 2026.

**Key Rationale**:
1. Market opportunity exists—European CFOs face same challenges, fewer specialized vendors
2. Inbound demand signal validates interest
3. Test-first approach validates demand before committing resources ($100-150K vs. $500K)
4. GDPR compliance manageable, timing favorable

**Critical Next Steps**: Wednesday's European prospect call, GDPR compliance review ($5-10K, 4 weeks), define success metrics

---

## Context

**Why Now**: European prospect reaching out for Wednesday call

**Drivers**: US market crowding (FinanceAI Corp, Big 4, Oracle), need new markets for 3-year revenue goals ($10M → $25M)

**Current Situation**: $8M ARR, 25 US clients, team at 90% capacity

**Constraints**: No European team, limited understanding of European buying process

---

## Analysis

### Market/External
- **Market Size**: €200-400M mid-market AI-enabled FP&A in Europe
- **Trends**: European CFOs 12-18 months behind US but accelerating (45% prioritizing AI by 2026)
- **Competition**: Less saturated than US, few specialized vendors
- **Regulatory**: GDPR required (manageable), EU AI Act starts Aug 2026

### Internal
- **Strengths**: Proven methodology, AI expertise, remote delivery
- **Gaps**: GDPR compliance, European timezone coverage, multi-currency ERP
- **Strategic Fit**: Aligns with vision ("Transform finance globally")
- **Financial**: $100-150K test investment, breaks even with 1-2 clients

---

## Options

### Option 1: Full European Expansion
- Hire European sales team, invest $500K+ over 12-18 months
- **Pros**: Fastest to market share
- **Cons**: High risk on unvalidated market, resource drain
- **Risk**: High

### Option 2: Test-First Approach (Recommended)
- Accept European inbound, deliver 2-3 pilots, evaluate and decide
- **Pros**: Low risk ($100-150K), validates demand, builds case studies
- **Cons**: Slower market entry
- **Risk**: Low

### Option 3: Wait & Watch
- Decline European opportunities, revisit in 12-18 months
- **Pros**: Full US focus
- **Cons**: Miss first-mover advantage
- **Risk**: Low (no risk, no upside)

### Option 4: Partnership Model
- Partner with European firm, they sell, you deliver
- **Pros**: Leverage partner's presence
- **Cons**: Less control, lower revenue per project
- **Risk**: Medium

---

## Recommendation

**Choose Option 2: Test-First Approach**

**Why**: Validates demand with minimal risk. Builds credibility through 2-3 successful projects. Learns before committing. Doesn't distract from US focus.

**Why Not Others**: Option 1 too risky without validation, Option 3 misses opportunity, Option 4 hard to find right partner quickly

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk 1: GDPR Non-Compliance**
- Likelihood: Medium | Impact: High
- Mitigation: Hire European attorney ($5-10K, 4 weeks), update processes
- Owner: COO + legal

**Risk 2: Timezone Support Strain**
- Likelihood: Medium | Impact: Medium
- Mitigation: Limit to 2-3 projects, rotate coverage, comp time
- Owner: You + COO

**Risk 3: Competitive Entry**
- Likelihood: Medium | Impact: Medium
- Mitigation: Move quickly, build case studies, decide by Q3 2026
- Owner: You

## Implementation Plan

### Immediate (Next 30 Days)
- [ ] Wednesday prospect call: discovery, assess fit
- [ ] Engage attorney for GDPR review

### Phase 1: Test (Dec 2025 - June 2026)
- Deliver 2-3 European projects
- Complete GDPR compliance
- Gather feedback on pricing and needs
- Build case studies

**Milestones**: Month 3: 1 project delivered | Month 6: Decision on full GTM

### Phase 2: Decision Point (July 2026)
Evaluate results, decide: full GTM, continue test, partnership, or stop

---

## Resources Required

**Budget (6-Month Test)**: $100-150K total
- GDPR compliance: $5-10K
- Marketing: $5-10K/quarter
- Timezone support: $5-10K/quarter

**People**: Existing team, 2-3 providing EU coverage (compensated)

**No New Hires** during test

---

## Success Metrics

**Test Phase Criteria (6 Months)**:
- ✅ At least 5 European inbound leads
- ✅ Convert 2-3 to paying clients
- ✅ Client satisfaction ≥ 8/10
- ✅ Revenue covers costs ($200-300K from projects covers $100-150K investment)
- ✅ Margins similar to US (40-50%)

**Trigger to Scale**: If criteria met AND pipeline reaches $1M+

**Trigger to Pivot/Stop**: If <5 leads, <40% conversion, team strain, or <30% margins
