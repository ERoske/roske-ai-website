## Positioning & Repositioning Guidance

### "What I Do" vs. "What I Don't Do" Framework

When helping define services:

**What I Do**:
- Be specific about offerings
- Describe ideal clients
- Articulate unique approach
- Quantify outcomes when possible

**What I Don't Do** (Why Include This?):
- Filters out bad-fit inquiries
- Demonstrates focus and expertise
- Manages expectations upfront
- Shows confidence in niche

**Example**:

✅ GOOD:
"I facilitate strategic planning sessions for leadership teams navigating organizational change. I help groups of 10-50 leaders align on vision, make decisions, and commit to action."

"I don't: Provide one-on-one executive coaching, deliver training programs, or consult on implementation. For those needs, I can refer you to trusted partners."

❌ BAD:
"I do strategy stuff for companies."

### Repositioning Strategy

When client needs to pivot focus:

1. **Audit Current Positioning**
   - What does site currently communicate?
   - What audience does it attract?
   - What needs to change?

2. **Define New Positioning**
   - New focus area
   - New target audience
   - New value proposition
   - What expertise to emphasize

3. **Update Content**
   - Homepage: New headline and value prop
   - About: Reframe story toward new direction
   - Services: Lead with new offerings, deprioritize old
   - Case studies: Feature relevant work

4. **SEO Transition**
   - Maintain old keywords (keep existing traffic)
   - Add new keywords (build new traffic)
   - Update page titles and descriptions
   - Create new content for new focus

## Common Website Types

### Facilitation/Consulting Services

**Key Pages**:
- Services (very specific about what/how)
- Approach/Philosophy (your methodology)
- Who I Work With (ideal clients)
- Sample Session Agendas (show what they'll experience)

**Copy Approach**:
- Process-oriented (show how you work)
- Outcome-focused (what changes)
- Collaborative language (partnership, not expert/client)

### Thought Leadership/Personal Brand

**Key Pages**:
- About (compelling personal narrative)
- Insights/Writing (showcase thinking)
- Speaking (for speaking engagements)
- Media/Press (credibility builders)

**Copy Approach**:
- Point of view (what you believe)
- Storytelling (make ideas memorable)
- Authority signals (without arrogance)

### Professional Services

**Key Pages**:
- Services (clear deliverables)
- Process (what to expect)
- Pricing (if transparent)
- Case Studies (proof)

**Copy Approach**:
- Results-focused (ROI, outcomes)
- Trust-building (credentials, testimonials)
- Clear next steps (strong CTAs)

## SEO Best Practices

### Keyword Integration

Natural keyword usage:
- ✅ "I help CFOs implement AI strategies that improve forecasting accuracy and reduce month-end close time."
- ❌ "CFO AI strategy implementation forecasting accuracy month-end close AI for CFOs."

### Content Structure

- **Scannable**: Short paragraphs, headers, bullets
- **Skimmable**: Key points stand out
- **Accessible**: Simple language, defined jargon
- **Actionable**: Clear next steps

### Local SEO (If Applicable)

- Location in title tags and meta descriptions
