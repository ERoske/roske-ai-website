## Interview Best Practices

### Do's
- ✅ Ask open-ended questions
- ✅ Listen more than you talk (80/20 rule)
- ✅ Follow interesting threads even if off-script
- ✅ Ask for specific examples and stories
- ✅ Be comfortable with silence (let them think)
- ✅ Take notes on quotable lines
- ✅ Note their energy/emphasis (what they care about)

### Don'ts
- ❌ Ask yes/no questions (unless intentional)
- ❌ Lead the witness ("Don't you think that...")
- ❌ Interrupt good stories
- ❌ Stick rigidly to script if conversation is flowing
- ❌ Ask multiple questions at once
- ❌ Fill every silence immediately

### Recovery Techniques

**If they give short answers**:
- "That's interesting - can you say more about that?"
- "Help me understand what you mean by [term they used]"
- "Can you walk me through how that worked?"

**If they go off-topic**:
- "That's fascinating - I want to make sure we cover [topic]. Can we circle back to..."
- "I'd love to hear more about that. First, on [original topic]..."

**If you don't understand**:
- "I want to make sure I get this right - are you saying [paraphrase]?"
- "Can you help me understand the connection between X and Y?"

**If answer is too general**:
- "Can you give me a specific example of that?"
- "What did that look like in practice for you?"

## Question Quality Guidelines

### Great Questions

**Specific but Open-Ended**:
- ✅ "Tell me about a time when you had to make a difficult decision about AI adoption. How did you approach it?"
- ❌ "Do you think AI is important?" (yes/no)
- ❌ "Tell me about your career." (too broad)

**Focused on Experience**:
- ✅ "Walk me through your process for evaluating new technologies."
- ❌ "What do most CFOs do?" (they can only speak for themselves)

**Exploration over Validation**:
- ✅ "What surprised you about implementing AI in your finance operations?"
- ❌ "AI implementation is challenging, isn't it?" (leading)

**Stories over Opinions**:
- ✅ "Tell me about the first time you realized your industry was changing."
- ✅ "What's an example of where this approach succeeded/failed?"

### Question Types & When to Use

**Opening Questions** (build rapport):
- "How did you get into [field/role]?"
- "What attracted you to [topic]?"

**Experience Questions** (get stories):
- "Walk me through..."
- "Tell me about a time when..."
- "Describe the process of..."

**Opinion Questions** (get perspective):
- "What's your take on..."
- "How do you think about..."
- "Where do you stand on..."

- "How does [approach A] compare to [approach B]?"

**Predictive Questions** (get forward-looking insights):
- "Where do you see [topic] heading?"
- "What trends are you watching?"
- "What should [audience] prepare for?"

**Advice Questions** (get actionable insights):
- "What would you tell someone who..."
