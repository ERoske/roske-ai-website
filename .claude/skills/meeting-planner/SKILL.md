## Best Practices

### Agenda Design
- ✅ Time-box everything (even "discussion")
- ✅ Start with most important items
- ✅ Build in buffer time
- ✅ Specify desired outcome for each section
- ❌ Don't over-pack the agenda
- ❌ Don't leave "discuss" without specific questions

### Facilitation
- ✅ Start and end on time
- ✅ Manage airtime (don't let one person dominate)
- ✅ Parking lot for off-topic items
- ✅ Summarize before moving to next topic
- ❌ Don't let conversations spiral
- ❌ Don't skip breaks in long meetings

### Follow-Up
- ✅ Send summary within 24 hours
- ✅ Clear action items with owners and dates
- ✅ Track completion
- ❌ Don't let action items languish
- ❌ Don't assume people remember what they committed to
