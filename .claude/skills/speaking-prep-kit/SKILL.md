## Event Overview

**Event**: Finance Innovation Summit
**Your Role**: Panelist on "Practical AI Implementation in Finance" (60min panel, Sunday 2pm)
**Audience**: 300+ CFOs, VPs Finance, Controllers
**Opportunity**: Thought leadership + client leads + see sons in Miami

---

**Knowledge Level**: Beginner-intermediate on AI, expert on finance pain points
**Skepticism**: Healthy skeptics—want proof not promises

---

## Key Messages

### 1. AI in Finance Is Real Today, Not Tomorrow
The question isn't "should we?" but "where do we start?"

### 2. Start with Pain, Not Technology
Failed projects start with "let's use AI." Successful ones start with "variance analysis takes 40 hours—how do we fix that?"

### 3. Small Bets, Quick Wins, Then Scale
Pick one use case, prove ROI in 4-6 weeks, expand. Quick wins build momentum.

### 4. Your Team Won't Be Replaced, They'll Be Upgraded
AI handles repetitive analysis, team focuses on strategic questions. Better work, not less work.

### 5. Implementation > Technology
Tech works. Hard part is change management, data quality, stakeholder buy-in. Budget 60% on people/process, 40% on tech.

## Talk Structure (60min Panel)

**Your Opening** (60sec if asked to introduce yourself):
"I'm Edward Roske, CEO of [companies]. I work with finance leaders drowning in spreadsheets. We help them implement AI to automate boring stuff so teams can focus on strategic questions. I also teach this—speak at CFO events, run workshops. Before this, spent years in data science and EPM, so I've lived the pain points."

**Panel Contributions** (15-20min total speaking):

**On "What works in AI for finance"**:
Start small, prove value. Example: $50M SaaS company, variance analysis took 40hrs/month. Automated it—now 2hrs, catches 90% of variances. That's a quick win.

Tactical takeaway: Pick one process, measure current time/quality, prove ROI in 4-6 weeks, then scale.

**On "What doesn't work"**:
Don't start with technology. Failures follow same pattern: saw cool demo, bought tool, spent 6 months figuring out what to use it for. That's backwards.

Tactical takeaway: Write one-page problem statement before looking at vendors.

**On "ROI and business case"**:
Quantify before state ruthlessly. How many hours? Error rate? Opportunity cost? Your ROI case: "We freed up senior analyst to build profitability model CEO requested" not "We saved 38 hours."

**On "Change management"**:
Address fear head-on. Every team fears "Is AI taking my job?" If you don't address this explicitly, you get passive resistance. Be honest: "AI will change your role. Less Excel, more strategic advisory. That's a promotion, not a threat."

**Closing Thoughts** (90sec):
"Three things: One, AI in finance is real and delivers ROI. Question is where to start. Two, start small—pick one painful process, prove value, build momentum. Three, this is as much people challenge as technology challenge. Get that right and tech is easy part."

## Stories & Examples

**Story 1: The 40-Hour Variance Analysis**
$50M SaaS, senior analyst spent 40hrs/month on variance analysis, burned out, considering quitting. Automated it—40hrs→2hrs. Freed her to build customer cohort analysis. Went from "I hate my job" to "this is why I went into finance."
**Use for**: Start with pain, quick wins, upgrade not replace

**Story 2: The Team That Thought AI Would Replace Them**
Finance team of 10, VP announced "AI transformation," team feared replacement, pilot stalled 6 months. VP sat them down: "What are you worried about?" Team: "We'll be obsolete." VP showed new org chart—each role elevated to strategic work. Team: "That actually sounds better." Pilot completed in 4 weeks, team became advocates.
**Use for**: Change management importance

## Q&A Prep (10 Anticipated Questions)

**Q: How much does AI implementation cost?**
A: Depends on scope. Small pilot: $25-50K. Full process automation: $100-200K. Enterprise transformation: $500K+. But ROI context: If you're spending $25K/year in labor on a process, and AI cuts that to $5K, payback is under a year. Real cost is cost of waiting while competitors move faster.

**Q: How long does implementation take?**
A: Quick wins: 4-6 weeks for single use case. Full implementation: 3-6 months. Recommend phased: 4-6 week pilot, prove value, then expand. Companies that succeed treat this like agile—iterate, learn, adjust.

**Q: What about data quality? Our data is a mess.**
A: Everyone's data is a mess. Don't wait for perfect data—you'll wait forever. Start with good-enough data, improve iteratively. AI can actually help clean data. Pick use case where data is best, build confidence, then tackle harder problems.

**Q: How do we choose vendors?**
A: Three-step filter: (1) Start with your problem, share that with vendors. If they pitch platform without understanding problem, walk away. (2) Ask for customer references, talk to them without vendor present. (3) Run proof of concept with your data, not their demo data. 4-6 weeks, measure results.

**Q: What if CFO isn't bought in?**
A: Build mini business case: Quantify one painful process ($25K/year labor cost, 40hrs/month). Propose small pilot ($30K, 6 weeks). If it works, ROI is 12 months. If fails, you learned for $30K not $300K. Show competitive pressure—competitors doing this, moving faster.
