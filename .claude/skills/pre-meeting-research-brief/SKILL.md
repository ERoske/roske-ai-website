## Talking Points & Questions

### Discovery Questions (10-15 min)
"Walk me through your current FP&A process. What's working? What's frustrating?"
"How long does monthly close take? Where do you spend the most time?"
"When you think about scaling to $100M ARR, what keeps you up at night from a finance ops perspective?"

### Qualification Questions
"Have you allocated budget for this, or would it need approval?"
"What's your timeline? Is there a deadline driving this?"
"Who else would be involved in a decision like this?"

### Strategic Questions
"Most CFOs I talk to struggle with the ROI case for AI in finance. How are you thinking about measuring success?"
"You're in HR tech where there's lots of AI hype. How do you cut through noise to find tools that actually work?"

### Conversation Starters
**Opening**: "Thanks for making time, Sarah. Rather than me talking at you about what we do, I'd love to understand your current situation first."

**Mutual Connection**: "Jennifer Martinez mentioned you two worked together at SalesHub. She's been great to work with on their FP&A transformation."

**Compliment**: "I read your CFO Magazine quote about finance transformation—you nailed the tension between moving fast and maintaining control."
