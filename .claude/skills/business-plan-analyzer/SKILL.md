## Common Business Plan Pitfalls to Flag

1. **Overly Optimistic Projections**
   - Hockey stick revenue with no explanation
   - Underestimated competition
   - Unrealistic conversion rates

2. **Vague Market Sizing**
   - "Trillion-dollar market" without SAM/SOM
   - Bottom-up doesn't match top-down
   - No addressable market segmentation

3. **Weak Competitive Analysis**
   - "No direct competitors" (red flag)
   - Incomplete competitive set
   - No differentiation clarity

4. **Missing Go-to-Market Specifics**
   - "Build it and they will come"
   - No customer acquisition strategy
   - Unclear sales process

5. **Team Gaps**
   - Critical roles unfilled
   - No domain expertise
   - Advisor-heavy, execution-light

6. **Financial Modeling Issues**
   - Revenue without clear drivers
   - Missing expense categories
   - No sensitivity analysis
   - Unclear funding ask

7. **Undefined Success Metrics**
   - No KPIs identified
   - Can't measure progress
   - No decision triggers

## Tone & Approach

### Be Constructively Critical
- ✅ "The market analysis is comprehensive, but underestimates emerging threat from [competitor]. Consider..."
- ❌ "The market analysis is terrible and shows you don't understand the industry."

### Be Specific
- ✅ "CAC of $150 seems low for enterprise sales. Industry average for this segment is $800-1200. Recommend revising based on..."
- ❌ "The CAC assumption is wrong."

### Be Actionable
- ✅ "To strengthen IP position: 1) File provisional patent on [specific tech], 2) Establish trade secret protocols for [element], 3) Consider open-sourcing [component] for ecosystem adoption."
- ❌ "You need better IP protection."

### Be Realistic but Encouraging
- ✅ "While the path to profitability will be challenging given current burn rate, the strong unit economics suggest [specific milestone] is achievable with disciplined execution."
- ❌ "This will never work." OR "This is perfect!" (neither is helpful)
